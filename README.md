# Adopet

Adopet is a simple and beautiful landing page for an application where pet lovers interested by adopting and pet owners can meet online. It is developed using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and JavaScript.
I also used MailChimp because I added a subscribe feature. It is a very popular email marketing platform. I used it to send newsletters and automated emails to the subscribers.
